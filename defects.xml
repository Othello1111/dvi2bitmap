<version>$Revision$</version>
<date>$Date$</date>

<p>This list contains the current defects/issues list for the
dvi2bitmap application.  As well as specific deficiencies, these
`defects' include items which are merely suggestions or TODOs</p>

<p>These are in no particular order, and some have a higher priority
than others.</p>

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF ELEMENTS IN THIS FILE.
     They're numbered when they're formatted, and it'd be nice to keep
     those numbers correct.

<title>dvi2bitmap crashes/hangs when given non-existent input file</title>
<p>Most mysterious.  The problem seems to be confined to versions of
the program build with gcc.  It builds OK using Sun's and Compaq's C++
compilers, and with egcs-2.91.66.  Eitan was using gcc 2.8.1 on a
Sparc and it dumped core; I tried building with apparently the same
compiler on a Sparc (hermes), and it didn't dump core, but it did seem
to hang.  Poking around with gdb suggests it's hanging somewhere in a
library destructor, but this is still a little obscure.</p>
