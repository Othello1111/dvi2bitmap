<title>dvi2bitmap defects/issues list</title>

<version>$Revision$</version>
<date>$Date$</date>

<p>This list contains the current defects/issues list for the
dvi2bitmap application.  As well as specific deficiencies, these
`defects' include items which are merely suggestions or TODOs</p>

<p>These are in no particular order, and some have a higher priority
than others.</p>

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF ELEMENTS IN THIS FILE.
     They're numbered when they're formatted, and it'd be nice to keep
     those numbers correct.

<defect status="open" originator="Eitan Gurari, gurari@cis.ohio-state.edu">
<title>dvi2bitmap crashes/hangs when given non-existent input file</title>
<p>Most mysterious.  The problem seems to be confined to versions of
the program build with gcc.  It builds OK using Sun's and Compaq's C++
compilers, and with egcs-2.91.66.  Eitan was using gcc 2.8.1 on a
Sparc and it dumped core; I tried building with apparently the same
compiler on a Sparc (hermes), and it didn't dump core, but it did seem
to hang.  Poking around with gdb suggests it's hanging somewhere in a
library destructor, but this is still a little obscure.</p>

<defect status="open" originator="Norman">
<title>Spacing at small sizes</title>
<p>Spacing in \scriptstyle is wrong.  If you write
$x^{123}$ or ${\scriptstyle \cos x}$, the `123' and the `cos' are
strung out from each other.  At first, I thought this was to do with
the drift-checking, described in the DVI standard section 2.6.2,
perhaps because maths fonts have several zero fontdimen parameters
(see the TeXBook, appendix F) but it persists even when that's turned
right off.  Also, it's actually wrong when using cmr7 (in my test
files at least -- I haven't yet investigated with other small fonts),
not in specifically maths fonts.  Most puzzling.</p>
