/**
 * Abstracts a file as a stream of bytes.  Functions are provided to
 * read individual bytes from the file and blocks of contiguous
 * bytes.
 *
 * <p>Since this class is intended to help reading TeX DVI and PK
 * files, we also provide methods to read signed and unsigned
 * integers from the stream, encoded as described in the DVI driver
 * standard.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to be extended (and is extended in fact
 * in classes {@link FileByteStream} and {@link PipeStream}).  The
 * subclassing interface consists of a no-argument constructor, a
 * method to associate the class with a given file descriptor ({@link
 * #bindToFileDescriptor}), and a convenience method to help opening
 * files, using the same specification syntax supported by this class
 * ({@link #openSourceSpec}).  Since one of the main purposes of this
 * subclassing is to support a class which handles a seekable input
 * stream, we also have {@link #getFD} to get the file descriptor
 * being handled, and {@link #reloadBuffer} to indicate to the parent
 * class that the underlying stream has been modified (typically by a
 * <code>seek</code> operation) so that the input buffer should be
 * invalidated.  If <code>bindToFileDescriptor</code> was invoked
 * with the <code>fillBufferAndClose</code> flag true, then the
 * {@link #bufferSeek} method allows rapid seeking by simply
 * adjusting the buffer pointer; though this is useless unless the
 * whole stream is in the buffer, the class makes no check on this,
 * and it is the extending class's responsibility to make sure that
 * this is not called inappropriately.
