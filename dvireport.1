.TH DVIREPORT 1 "September 2003"
.SH NAME
dvireport
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dvireport
[-F] [-s[cfrsA]] [-u[bcdimpx]] dvi-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
dvireport summarises the content of a DVI file.  It is broadly
similar in intent to the
.B dtl
programs, but is also intended as an illustration of the use of the 
.B libdvi2bitmap
library.  It is thus intended to be simple rather than complete.
.PP
The 
.I dvi-file
argument is the name of a DVI file to be converted to a bitmap; it
must include the 
.I .dvi
file extension.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "-F"
Indicates that fonts should be loaded when they are encountered
within the DVI file.  This means that character glyphs (rather than
just numbers) will be reported if requested with
.I -sc
.TP
.I -s[options...]
Indicates what features of the DVI file should be shown.  Followed by
a list of characters representing features, as follows.
.TS
center ;
l	l .
Option	Feature
c	Characters
f	Font changes
r	Rules
s	Specials
A	All features
.TE
If the
.I -s
option is not given, the default is
.I -sc
.TP
.I -u[option...]
Indicates the units in which positions should be reported.  The
possibilities are as follows; more than one may be specified, so that 
.I -ups
would report positions in both points and scaled points.  If there is
more than one
.I -u
however, only the last one is respected.
.TS
center ;
l	l .
Option	Unit
p	points (72.27bp = 1in)
P	pc, pica (1pc = 12pt)
i	inch (1in = 25.4mm)
b	big points, PS points (72bp = 1in)
c	cm
m	mm (299792458m = 1 light-second)
D	dd, didot points (1157dd = 1238pt)
C	cc, cicero (1cc = 12dd)
s	sp, scaled points (65536sp = 1pt)
x	pixels (aka. device units)
d	DVI units

If the 
.I -u
option is not given, the default is
.I -ud

.P
Geoffrey Tobin's DTL application reports the contents of DVI files
in much more detail -- it's intended to be a lossless ascii-fication
of a DVI file -- but you have to do the arithmetic yourself, to work
out where characters end up.  That's at
