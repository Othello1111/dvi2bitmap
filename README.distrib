This software is bundled according to two different packaging
conventions.

If you are on a Starlink node, then the package should build in the
usual Starlink fashion: define the environment variables SYSTEM and
INSTALL appropriately, then type `./mk build' and `./mk install'.

Otherwise, unpack the source in dvi2bitmap_source.tar: the README
there will tell you to type `./configure' and `make'.

Documentation is in doc.tar.  The software is free for non-commercial
use: see the file LICENCE.
