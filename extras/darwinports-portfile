### DOES NOT FULLY WORK
### This works to the extent that it does build the software apparently
### correctly.  However it has to assume the locations of the kpathsea library
### (because there's no kpathsea darwinport, or at least not yet) and of
### mktexpk, because Gerben Wierda's teTeX installation isn't managed by
### DarwinPorts.

description     Convert TeX DVI files to bitmaps directly
long_description        dvi2bitmap converts TeX DVI files directly to bitmaps, \
                        without going through the complicated (and slow!) \
                        route of conversion via PostScript and PNM.  \
                        It consists of a thin application, using a library \
                        which can read DVI and PK files.

# The following are not ideal, because they depend on kpathsea having been
# installed somehow or other, and teTeX having been installed, probably by
# Gerben Wierda's iInstaller.  The first can be supplied by the `TeX programs
# (developer extras)' option of the Wierda installation, or by me working out
# how to do a darwinports portfile for kpathsea.  The second should be easy,
# but the `port' command overrides the PATH variable, so we can't check for 
# mktexpk in the path -- grrr.
