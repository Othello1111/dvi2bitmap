% This TeX file allows us to check that dvi2bitmap's handling of DVI
% and PK file magnification is correct.
%
% We display a sentence in cmr10 with two different scalings (to check
% that DVI per-font scaling is working OK), as well as with cmr7 and
% cmr12, to check that different fonts are having their design size
% interpreted correctly.  Finally, the whole file has a
% \magnification, so that everything is magnified except the cmr10
% used at 10 true pt.  If all this looks like its maker intended, I
% think I can claim that I've got fonts licked.
