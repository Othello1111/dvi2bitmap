# Run a series of tests on moggy.  The directory contains a collection
# of scripts named `t<number>', and these are executed in turn and their
# output diffed against `t<number>.correct'.  Exit status is the
# number of failures.
#
# The tests should consist of scripts (or programs) which write their
# results to stdout, write any debugging information to stderr, and
# put any temporary files in filenames matching the pattern
# `t<number>*.tmp' but not delete them (for debugging).  All these
# files are deleted on successful completion, unless the --keep flag
# is present.
#
# Run without an argument, and if there is no file runtests.filelist,
# this runs all the tests in the directory; run with an argument, it
# runs only the specified tests.
#
# If there is no argument, but a file runtests.filelist exists, use
# that file's contents as the list of tests to run.  This means that
# we can make it easy to do a subset of the tests repeatedly while
# testing.
#
# If the option --keep is present, then it doesn't delete temporary files.
