    <h2>Features</h2>

    <p><code>dvi2bitmap</code> is a utility to convert TeX DVI files
    directly to bitmaps, without going through the complicated (and
    slow!) route of conversion via PostScript and PNM.  The prime
    motivation for this is to prepare mathematical equations for
    inclusion in HTML files, but there is a broad range of uses beyond
    that.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>dvi2bitmap</code> is written in portable C++, and the
        program acts as a wrapper
        round the <code>libdvi2bitmap</code> library (both static and
        shareable), which abstracts DVI and PK files and their
        contents, Bitmaps, and various other objects supporting these.
        The library has extensive <a href="doc_libdvi2bitmap/" >API
          documentation</a>, and is intended to be useful for other
        projects.</li>

      <li>It can generate XBM, XPM and GIF bitmaps, plus PNG, if you
        have the libpng library installed.</li>

      <li>Uses the same kpathsea
        font-searching library as other TeX programs, again as long as
        you have the appropriate library installed.</li>

      <li>Can read DVI files from a pipe.</li>

      <li>Internal bitmaps now automatically expandable.</li>

      <li>It's fast</li>

      <li>Documentation improvements, discussing optimal font and parameter 
        choices, and usage of dvi2bitmap as part of a batched workflow (ie, 
        fancy pipe plumbing).</li>

      <li>Builds using automake/libtool.  Builds successfully on
        Linux, MacOS X, Solaris, and Digital Unix (that I know of); it
        should (?!) be buildable under Cygwin
	(reports keenly appreciated).</li>

      <li>Released under the GPL</li>

      <li><em>In this release</em>: Minor bugfixes.  The main
        motivation for this release is that the sources have been
        transferred to sourceforge.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Notes</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>There are <a href="sampler/sampler.html">font samples</a> to
        illustrate what <code>dvi2bitmap</code> can do.</li>

      <!-- <li>Current <webref url='issues.html'>issues list</webref> -->

      <li>The software is copyright, 1999--2005, Council of the
        Central Laboratories of the Research Councils, and is released under
        the terms of the GNU General Public Licence: see the file
        <code>LICENCE</code> within the distribution.</li>

      <li>dvi2bitmap is also archived in CTAN, at

    </ul>

    <p>This package was first released informally back in 1999, after a low-key
      announcement on comp.text.tex (I think), with a 1.0 version number.
      That's inappropriate for beta software, so in the first proper
      release, the version number was dropped to 0.7.</p>
