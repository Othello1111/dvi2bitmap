<px>This application processes a DVI file produced by &tex;,
converting each page to a single bitmap.
</abstract>

<sect id=intro export>Introduction

<p>It is sometimes useful to convert the typeset output of &tex; into
a bitmap image viewable on the web.  This is most often the case when
&tex; or &latex; are being used to typeset the mathematics in a paper
being conveted to HTML.  It is possible to do this with a chain of
general-purpose tools, for example going from DVI to postscript to PNM
files to GIFs, but this is generally slow.  For an overview of maths
and SGML/HTML, see <ref id=sgml.maths>.

<p>The tool dvi2bitmap does this processing in a single step, reading
the DVI file and font files, and emitting a bitmap.  It can, at
present, generate XBM and GIF files.

<p>See <ref id=usage> for usage instructions, and <ref id=install> for
installation instructions.

<p>The <code/dvi2bitmap/ application is available for download at 
<url>http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/norman/star/dvi2bitmap/</url>.
<![ %Only.web [
This HTML documentation is also available as a 
<webref url='dvi2bitmap.single.html' >single file</webref>
]]>

<p>This document matches version 1.0-7 of the program (you can see
what version you have with the command <kbd/dvi2bitmap -V/).  This
should currently be regarded as beta software.

<sect id=usage export>Usage
<update versionid=upd3>Added a description of my usage model, to help
make things a little clearer.</update>

<p>Synopsis:
<verbatim>
dvi2bitmap 
    [-f font-path] [-r resolution] [-m magnification] [-P[bt]]
    [-s scalefactor] [-t gif|xbm] [-o output] [-b(h|w) size]
    [-c[lrtb] dimen] [-C[lrtb] dimen] [-nqQV] [-L[L]]
    [-p num] [-l num] [-pp ranges]
    dvi-file
</verbatim>

<p>This program is intended to conform to the DVI processing standard.

<p>The motivation for this program was the need for a helper program
to produce small bitmaps for inclusion in web pages.  Accordingly, my
model of the way the program is used is that it will process a file of
&tex; or &latex; material generated specifically for it.  These will
typically be equations, but any other &tex; material should work as
well.  For example, the processor which generates the HTML could spit
out a file such as
<verbatim>
\documentclass{article}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
$E=mc^2$
\newpage
% etc...
\end{document}
</verbatim>
and then this program can scoot through it turning each page into a
bitmap.  I had thought about some complicated scheme to delimit areas
on the page, but realised that since the file being processed would
typically be generated on the fly specifically for processing by a
tool like this, this wasn't really necessary.

<p>I hope that the program is (or can be made to be) flexible enough
to support other modes of use.

<subsect id=usage.options export>Options
<update versionid="upd5">Added documentation of -c and -C options</update>
<update versionid="post-upd5">Added documentation of -p, -l, -pp
options.  Note that the old -l and -L options have changed into the
new -L and -LL options.</update>
<update versionid="upd7">Clarified the -p, -l and -pp options.</update>

<p><dl>
<dt><code>-bh size, -bw size</code>
<dd>Specify the height and width of the canvas on which the output
bitmap is painted.  The program tries to make an estimate of this
based on information within the DVI file, but it can't efficiently get
all the information it needs, so sometimes the estimate is wrong.  If
you get a warning message like <code>Warning: p.12: bitmap too big:
occupies (1183,1072)...(4134,6255).  Requested 4100x6200</code>, then 
you'll need to specify a bitmap size.  The numbers
<code>(1183,1072)...(4134,6255)</code> are the coordinates of the top-left and
bottom-right of the bitmap: in this case <code>-bh 6300 -bw
4200</code> would suffice.  Note that the `h' in <code>-bh</code> stands for
height, not horizontal!  At some point, I'd like to make the bitmap
`expandable', obviating the need for these options.

<dt><code>-c[edge] dimen, -C[edge] dimen</code>
<dd>The <code/-c/ and <code/-C/ options allow you to control how the
generated bitmaps are cropped before they are written.  The
<code/[edge]/ may be one of `l', `r', `t' or `b', referring to the
left, right, top and bottom edge of the bitmap, or be missing, in
which case it refers to all four sides.  In the case of the <code/-c/
option, this sets the crop to be <code/dimen/ points from the
specified edge of the
bounding box of the blackened pixels; in the case of the <code/-C/
option, it sets it to be <code/dimen/ points from the left or top of
the `page'.  The specification <code/-C dimen/, which would set all
the crops to the same position, is silly, and so is forbidden.
<p>The conversion from points to pixels takes account of the
magnification set in the <code/-m/ option, if that's been specified
already, but it doesn't notice if that's set after this option, and it
takes no account of any magnification in the DVI file. 
<p>See <ref id=usage.special> for &tex; <code/\special/ commands which
set this within the &tex; file.

<dt><code>-fp font-path</code>
<dd>Specifies the path to the PK fonts which dvi2bitmap will use.  See
also <ref id=usage.fonts>.

<dt><code>-fm mode</code>
<dd>Specify the MetaFont mode which is to be used when generating fonts.
The default is <code/ibmvga/, but see
<code/&ddash;enable-fontgen/ in <ref id=install.nonstarlink>.

<dt><code/-fg/
<dd>Switch off automatic font-generation.

<dt><code/-fG/
<dd>Switch on automatic font-generation.

<dt><code>-l pagenum</code>
<dd>See option <code/-p/

<dt><code>-L</code>
<dd>Show missing fonts.
The program writes on standard output one line per missing font, with
five fields: the 
font name, the DPI value it was looking for, the base-DPI of the font,
the magnification factor, and a dummy metafont mode.
This output can 
be used with the mktexpk (TeXLive) or MakeTeXPK (teTeX) scripts to
generate the required fonts.
<p>The the option is <code/-LL/, then do the same, 
except that found fonts are also listed, prefixed by a % character.

<dt><code>-m magnification</code>
<dd>The &tex; magnification parameter which is used when processing the DVI
file. It is a float, with 1.0 corresponding to no magnification (the
default).  This interacts with the resolution as follows: if you
specify a resolution of 100, and a magnification of 2, then dvi2bitmap
will search for PK files at 200 dpi.

<dt><code>-n</code>
<dd>Do not actually process the DVI file, but read the DVI pre- and
postamble.  Useful in conjunction with the 
<code>-L</code>
option.  If this option is present, then the program returns non-zero
if any fonts were missing.

<dt><code>-o output</code>
<dd>Choose the output filename pattern.  The value is a 
`printf' formatting string, with a single <code>%d</code>
formatting descriptor, which will be replaced in output filenames
with the page number.  This can be overridden on a per-page basis by
a &tex; <code/\special/ embedded in the DVI file (see <ref
id=usage.special>).  If there is no 
file extension, or if it does not match the output type, a suitable file
extension will be added.

<dt><code/-p pnum/, <code/-l lnum/, <code/-pp pagelist/
<dd>These select page ranges, using a slight extension of the notation
used by <code/dvips/ (and the same option letters).

<p>The <code/-p/ and <code/-l/ options take single page numbers; if
either of these is given, then the program will process pages from
page <code/pnum/ to page <code/lnum/, with the defaults being the
corresponding extremes.  The <code/pagelist/ consists of a
comma-separated sequence of page numbers and ranges (<code/a-b/); only
those pages, and the pages falling in those ranges (inclusive of the
end pages) are processed.  Any of these specifications may be prefixed
by either `<code/=/' or `<code/:n,/'.  In the former case, DVI page
numbers are used rather than &tex; <code/\count/ registers; in the
latter case, the program examines the <code/\count/<m/n/ register
rather than the default <code/\count0/.

<p>You can specify both of these prefixes one or more times, but you
cannot mix the <code/-p/ and <code/-l/ options with the <code/-pp/
option.  The program will respect only the last <code/-p/ and
<code/-l/ options, but the <code/-pp/ options are cumulative.  There
may be no spaces in the <code/pagelist/.  The page numbers may be
negative.

<p>Examples:
<verbatim>
dvi2bitmap -pp 3,6-10 ... # process only the specified pages
dvi2bitmap -pp :2,1 ... # process only pages where \count2 was 1
</verbatim>

<dt><code/-P[bt]/
<dd>Specifies processing of the output bitmap.
<code/-Pb/ blurs the bitmap, making a half-hearted attempt to make a
low-resolution bitmap look better.  This really isn't up to much -- if
you have the fonts available, or are prepared to wait for them to be
generated, a better way is to use the <code/-m/ option to magnify the
DVI file, and then the <code/-s/ option to scale it back down to the
correct size.
<code/-Pt/ makes the output bitmap have a transparent background, if
that's supported by the particular format you choose using option
<code/-t/

<dt><code/-q/
<dd>Quiet mode -- suppress some chatter.

<dt><code/-Q/
<dd>Silent mode -- do not display warnings or errors.

<dt><code/-r resolution/
<dd>Specifies the output resolution, in pixels-per-inch.  This is used
when deciding which PK files to use.  The default is 110, but see
<code/&ddash;enable-fontgen/ in <ref id=install.nonstarlink>.

<dt><code/-s scalefactor/
<dd>Reduces the linear size of the output bitmap by a factor
<code/scalefactor/ (default 1).

<dt><code/-t type/
<dd>Choose the output format, which can be <code/xbm/ or <code/gif/.
The program generates XBM bitmaps by 
default.  The GIF option may not be available if it wasn't selected
when the program was configured.

<dt><code/-V/
<dd>Display the version number, and exit.

</dl>

<subsect id=usage.special export>DVI specials
<update versionid="upd5">
Rewritten to cover new special commands, particularly support for cropping.
</update>


<p>dvi2bitmap recognises several DVI special commands, and emits a
warning if it finds any others.

<p>The syntax of the special commands is 
<verbatim>
\special{dvi2bitmap &lt;special-command&gt;+ }
</verbatim>
There may be one or more <code>&lt;special-command&gt;</code>
sequences within a single special.

<p>The <code>&lt;special-command&gt;</code> which the program
recognises are:
<dl>

<dt><code>default</code>
<dd>Makes other special-commands in this same special affect
defaults.  See those commands for details.

<dt><code>outputfile my_filename</code>
<dd>The output file used for the current page will be named
<code/my_filename.gif/.  A filename extension will be added if none is
present, or if it does not match the output type selected.  If the
<code/default/ command has been given, then this instead specifies the
default filename pattern, and the `filename' should contain a single
<code/#/-sign.

<dt><code/absolute/
<dd>Affects the <code/crop/ command.

<dt><code>crop &lt;side&gt; &lt;dimen&gt;</code>
<dd>Crop the bitmap on the current page so that the specified edge of
the bitmap is <code/&lt;dimen&gt;/ points away from the bounding box
of the blackened pixels.  <code/&lt;side&gt;/ may be one of `left',
`right', `top', `bottom' or `all', referring to the corresponding
edge, or all four edges at once.  If the <code/default/ command has
been given in this special, then this pattern of cropping is
additionally made the default for subsequent pages.  If the
<code/absolute/ command has been given, then the crop position is set
at <code/&lt;dimen&gt;/ points from the appropriate edge of the
`paper'.
<p>The <code/-c/ and <code/-C/ command-line options
(<ref id=usage.options>) have the effect of setting initial defaults.
In the absence of either of these, the initial crop is exactly at the
bounding box.

</dl>

<p>For example, the pair of commands
<verbatim>
\special{dvi2bitmap default outputfile trial-#.gif crop all 5}
\special{dvi2bitmap absolute crop left 0}
</verbatim>
will change the output filename pattern for the rest of the DVI file,
and set a 5pt margin round the bounding box.  The current page,
however, will have a left-hand crop zero points in from the left hand
side.  Remember that &tex;'s origin is one inch from the left and the
top of the paper, and it is with respect to this origin that the
program reckons the absolute distances for the cropping.

<subsect id=usage.exit export>Exit value

<p>Exits with a non-zero status if there were any processing errors.
Having <em/no/ fonts present counts as a processing error; if there is
at least one font present, then missing fonts will be replaced by a
more-or-less randomly chosen alternative, and the program will produce a
warning if the <code/-Q/ option is not present, but it will return
with a zero (success) status.
See also the <code/-n/ option in <ref id=usage.options>.

<subsect id=usage.examples export>Examples

<p><verbatim>
% dvi2bitmap -r 110 -m 2 -s 2 -t gif hello.dvi
</verbatim>
This converts the file <code/hello.dvi/ to a GIF bitmap.  It first sets the
magnification factor to 2, so that the program uses a double-size font
(eg, <code>.../cmr10.220pk</code>), then scales the bitmap down by a
factor of 2 to obtain a bitmap of the correct size.

<p><verbatim>
% dvi2bitmap -n -L -r 110 -m 1.5 -Q hello.dvi
cmr10 165 110 1.5 localfont
</verbatim>
This reads the DVI file to find out what fonts are required, but does
not process it further.  It then tries to find the fonts, fails, and
produces a list of parameters which could be used to generate the
font files.  

<p>See also <ref id=usage.fonts>.

<subsect id=usage.fonts export>Finding and generating fonts
<update versionid="upd2">Renamed this section from vague
`environment', and moved description of font generation from
examples.</update>
<update versionid="upd3">Described new functionality for environment
variable.</update>

<subsubsect id=usage.fonts.finding>Finding fonts
<update versionid="post-upd5">Added a discussion of the foibles of the
texmf.cnf configuration file when it comes to finding fonts.
</update>
<update versionid="upd6">Mentioned &ddash;enable-fake-progname</update>

<p>The program searches in up to three places for fonts.

<ol>
<li>The <code/-f/ option specifies a colon-separated list of
directories which should be searched for font PK files.  If this is given on
the command line, it overrides&ellip

<li>The <code/DVI2BITMAP_PK_PATH/ environment variable, if defined,
specifies a colon-separated list of directories which are to be
searched for PK files.  If this variable is found in the environment,
it overrides&ellip

<li>If the program cannot find fonts using the environment variable,
and if it was configured with support for the Kpathsearch
library (see <ref id=install.nonstarlink>), then it should find PK
files using the same mechanism other DVI processors use.  

</ol>

<p>There are one or two possible wrinkles with the last method.  The
path-searching library is very powerful and flexible, but it is
possible to be tripped up by its configuration file.

<p>Firstly, the program has to <em/find/ the configuration file.  The
program should sort this out for itself at configuration time, but it
is possible that you might have to give it some help.  If you specify the
<code/TEXMFCNF/ environment variable, setting it to the directory
which contains your &tex; installation's <code/texmf.cnf/ file, then
this overrides the program's notion of where the configuration should
be.  You can find this file using the command <kbd/kpsewhich cnf
texmf.cnf/.

<p>It can sometimes happen that <code/dvi2bitmap/ fails to find fonts,
successfully calls <code/mktexpk/ to build them, but then <em/still/
fails to find them, even though <code/mktexpk/ has put them where they
should be.  The reason for this is as follows:

<p>Some <code/texmf.cnf/ files declare the location of the
user-writable font directory though a setting like
<verbatim>
VARTEXFONTS=$SELFAUTOPARENT/var/lib/texmf
</verbatim>
whereas others have something like
<verbatim>
VARTEXFONTS=$TEXMFLOCAL/fonts
</verbatim>
Now, <code/$SELFAUTOPARENT/ is a variable which is set
by the kpathsea library to be the grandparent directory of the executable
which uses the library.  So, for <code>/usr/bin/{tex,latex,mktexpk,...}</code>,
it's <code>/</code>, but if your <code/dvi2bitmap/ binary doesn't live
with the other dvi-ware then its <code/$SELFAUTOPARENT/ will be
different, so that <code/dvi2bitmap/ will look for fonts in a
<em/different/ place from the place where <code/mktexpk/ put them when
it successfully generated them.

<p>I would argue fairly strongly that having the <code/VARTEXFONTS/
directory depend on the location of the dvi-ware <em/executables/ is
a very silly thing to do, but unfortunately it's true in at least one
common &tex; distribution.  If you've fallen foul of this, then you
can either
<ul>
<li>change your <code/texmf.cnf/ file to something more like the
second example above; or
<li>install <code/dvi2bitmap/ along with the other &tex;ware.
</ul>
I'd prefer the first alternative, myself.

<p>A third option is to get <code/dvi2bitmap/ to work around the
problem, by telling it to claim to be some program which <em/is/
installed along with the other dvi-ware.  You do this with the
<code/&ddash;enable-fake-progname/ option to the configuration
script.  See <ref id=install.nonstarlink> for details.


<subsubsect>Generating fonts

<p>If you didn't enable automatic font-generation, or if you did and
something went wrong, you might have to generate fonts by hand.  You
need to look at the documentation for your &tex; system, specifically
the <code/mktexpk/ and <code/MakeTeXPK/ scripts (one of which might be
just an interface to the other).

<p>Since dvi2bitmap's default resolution is 72~dpi, as opposed to the
usual printer resolution of 300 or 600~dpi, you are unlikely to have
suitable fonts on your system, and will need to generate them.  The
program will generate these automatically, if it was configured with
support for that (see <ref id=install.nonstarlink>); if it wasn't
configured with that support, or if the automatic font generation
fails, you might need to generate the fonts by hand.

<p>How you generate fonts depends on your &tex; distribution.  As explained
in <ref id=usage.examples>, you can determine which fonts you need using the 
<code/-L/ option.  The teTeX and TeXLive &tex; distributions include scripts to
generate fonts for you; if you have a different distribution, there
might be a similar script for you to use, or you might have to do it
by hand.  In the case of teTeX, the command you'd use in the
example would be:
<verbatim>
% MakeTeXPK cmr10 165 110 1.5 ibmvga
</verbatim>
This would generate fonts using the <code/ibmvga/ Metafont mode, using
a base resolution of 110~dpi (the default for that mode), at a
magnification of 1.5 times, giving a resultant resolution of 165~dpi.

<p>If you're using the TeXLive distribution, the equivalent command would be:
<verbatim>
% mktexpk &ddash;mfmode ibmvga &ddash;mag 1.5 &ddash;bdpi 110 &ddash;dpi 165 cmr10
</verbatim>

<p>If you want to use the same mode as you
use for printing documents, then the mode
<code/localfont/ should do the right thing.  Otherwise, and probably
better if these images are intended for the screen rather than paper,
you could use a more specialised mode such as 
<code/ibmvga/,
which has been tweaked to be readable at small resolutions.  See the file
<code/modes.mf/
somewhere in your metafont distribution for the list of possibilities.

<p>After you have created the fonts, try giving the command
<verbatim>
% kpsewhich pk cmr10.165pk
</verbatim>
to confirm that &tex; and friends can find the new fonts, and that your 
dvi2bitmap environment variable is set correctly.  This command is
part of the <code/kpathsea/ distribution, rather than the core &tex;
distribution, so may not be present on your system.

<sect id=install export>Building and installing dvi2bitmap

<p>dvi2bitmap is packaged in two slightly different ways, one
which respects the bundling conventions of the <webref
url='http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk' >Starlink Project</webref> (the
project I work for), and one
which is more usual for network-distributed software.  

<p>When you unpack the distribution tarball, you should find at least
the files
<code/dvi2bitmap_source.tar/, <code/Makefile.starlink/ and <code/mk/.
You can build the software the Starlink way, using the <code/mk/
script (see <ref id=install.starlink>), or unpack the
<code/dvi2bitmap_source.tar/ file, and build it the other way (see
<ref id=install.nonstarlink>).  Since the <code/mk/ script is really
just a driver for the Makefile within the tar file, you should get the
same results both ways.

<subsect id=install.starlink export>Starlink nodes

<p>If you are on a Starlink node, then you
should be able to use the usual <code/mk/ script.  Define the
environment variables <code/INSTALL/ and <code/SYSTEM/ as usual.
<code/SYSTEM/ can be any one of the Starlink-supported platforms
<code/ix86_Linux/, <code/alpha_OSF1/ or <code/sun4_Solaris/.  Then
give the commands
<verbatim>
% ./mk build
% ./mk install
</verbatim>

<p>This build configures support for GIFs, plus support for the
<code/kpathsea/ library if that library is present on the system (it
is not distributed with this package and not present by default on all
project machines).

<subsect id=install.nonstarlink export>General installation and configuration
<update versionid="upd1">

<p>To configure and build:
<verbatim>
% ./configure
% make
</verbatim>
but see the configuration options below.

<p>To install, just copy the executable dvi2bitmap wherever you want it
to live.

<p>You can customise the program using flags to the
<code>./configure</code> command:
<dl>

<dt><code/&ddash;with-kpathsea/

<dd>If you want to use the <code/kpathsea/ library, which means that
the program finds font files using the same mechanism and the same
configuration file as other &tex;ware, then give the configure option
<code/&ddash;with-kpathsea/, and make sure that the <code/kpathsea/ include
files and library are somewhere the compiler will find them.  

<![ ignore [
For this
library to find its configuration files, you will either have to
install the program where the rest of the &tex;ware lives (you can
find this out with the command <kbd/which kpsewhich/), or tell it
where the <code/kpathsea/ configuration files are by setting the
environment variable <code/TEXMFCNF/ (use <kbd/kpsewhich cnf
texmf.cnf/ to find the configuration file, and set the environment
variable to the directory which contains that file -- I <em/think/
that some versions of the library require <code/TEXMFCNF/ to specify
the file rather than the directory).
]]>

If you don't have the
<code/kpathsea/ library available, see below (<ref id=install.web2c>)
for notes on obtaining it.
<!-- 
 (I don't believe it's installed by
the <code/TeXLive/ distribution, for example), then you can obtain a
copy from <webref url='http://www.tug.org' >TUG</webref> or <webref
url='http://www.tex.ac.uk' >CTAN</webref>, in <code
fspath>/tex-archive/systems/web2c/texk-n.n</code> (it seems
you can only get <code/kpathsea/ as part of the complete web2c
distribution, and not as a standalone library).
-->

<dt><code/&ddash;disable-texmfcnf/

<dd>The <code/kpathsea/ library finds its configuration files in two
ways, either automatically if it is installed in the same directory as
the rest of 
the &tex;ware, or using the <code/TEXMFCNF/ environment variable.  The
<code/dvi2bitmap/ program sets the latter variable internally, unless
it finds it already set.  If this will be inconvenient, you can
suppress this behaviour by providing the flag
<code/&ddash;disable-texmfcnf/, or equivalently
<code/&ddash;enable-texmfcnf=no/.

<dt><code/&ddash;enable-mktexpk/ and <code/&ddash;enable-maketexpk/
<dd>In the default configuration, the program will generate missing
fonts using one of the standard scripts present in most &tex;
distributions.  The configuration process looks first for
<code/mktexpk/ then <code/MakeTeXPK/, and uses whichever it
finds first.  If you have both scripts but wish to use
<code/MakeTeXPK/ for some reason, you will have to give the option
<code/&ddash;disable-mktexpk/; if you wish to disable both, you will
have to give <code/&ddash;disable-maketexpk/ as well.  Both options
take an optional argument giving the path to an alternative script
with the same calling interface.

<dt><code/&ddash;enable-gif/

<dd>The program generates only XBM bitmaps by default.  
If you want it to be able to generate GIFs, then give the configure
option <code/&ddash;enable-gif/.  The GIF format is the copyright of
CompuServe.  As far as I understand it, one does not need a licence
from CompuServe if one is distributing non-commercial, not-for-profit
software, such as this.  You probably shouldn't enable GIF support
when you build this program unless you're in that category as well.
But don't listen to me: there's a much fuller account of the whole
sorry business in the <webref
url='http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/internet/news/faq/archive/graphics.fileformats-faq.part1.html'
>comp.graphics.misc FAQ</webref>

<dt><code/&ddash;enable-fontgen/

<dd>By default, the program will attempt to generate fonts, and will
do so using the MetaFont mode <code/ibmvga/, which has a resolution of
110 dots-per-inch.

<p>If you wish to disable this automatic font
generation, give the option <code/--disable-fontgen/.
Note that this does not completely disable font generation -- it
merely sets the default for font generation to `off', and it can be
switched back on again using the option <code/-fG./

<p>If you wish
to change the default mode, you can do so with an argument to this
option.  For example, the option
<code/&ddash;enable-fontgen=pcprevw,118/ will make <code/pcprevw/,
which has a resolution of 118 dpi, the default MetaFont mode.  Note
that the resolution you specify <em/must/ match the mode: see file
<code/modes.mf/ for a list of modes and resolutions (use
<kbd/kpsewhich mf modes.mf/ to find this).  You can change the
resolution and mode on the fly using the <code/-fm/ and <code/-r/
options to the compiled program (<ref id=usage.options>).

<dt><code/&ddash;enable-fake-progname/

<dd>This option enables a workaround which allows <code/dvi2bitmap/ to
have the expected behaviour when (a) you do not install
<code/dvi2bitmap/ along with the other dvi-ware, and (b) your
<code/texmf.cnf/ file has <code/VARTEXFONTS/ or similar depend on one
of the <code/SELFAUTO.../ variables.  This option makes
<code/dvi2bitmap/ claim to be a different DVI-reading program which
<em/is/ installed in the standard place.  See <ref
id=usage.fonts.finding> for discussion.  The configuration script uses
the location of the <code/xdvi/ program by default, but you can
override this by giving the full path to an alternative as an argument
to this option.
<p>Since this uses undocumented behaviour of the library (`use the
source, Luke!'), you probably shouldn't enable it unless you have to.

</dl>

<p>The <code>./configure</code> command without any options is
equivalent to <code>./configure --with-kpathsea --enable-mktexpk</code>

<p>The program builds successfully on (at least) egcs-2.90, Sun Workshop
C++ 5.0, and Alpha Digital C++ 6.0 (with an irrelevant warning in the
latter case).  It should be written in
standards-conforming C++, so if it doesn't build then (1) it's not as
conformant as I think it is (in which case please tell me), (2) your
compiler is not as conformant as you think it is (in which case please
don't tell me), or (3) you need to invoke some magic to get the
compiler to be conformant (in which case tell me, if there's something
I can do in the autoconfigure script).

<p>You can override the C++ compiler the configure script will choose by
setting the environment variable <code/CXX/, either via 
<verbatim>
% CXX=cxx ./configure
</verbatim>
or
<verbatim>
% env CXX=cxx ./configure
</verbatim>
depending on your shell.

<subsubsect id=install.web2c>Obtaining the <code/kpathsea/ library
<update versionid="upd7">Improved instructions on getting the
kpathsea library source.</update>

<p>Not all &tex; distributions install the <code/kpathsea/ library,
even though they install applications which use it, and the
<code/texmf.cnf/ configuration file which controls it.

<p>If the library does not appear to be in your distribution, then you
can obtain and build it yourself.  The library is distributed as part
of the <code/web2c/ (Unix &tex; source) distribution, which you can
find at <url>ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/web2c.tar.gz</url>, or mirrored on
CTAN sites (for example at <url>http://www.tex.ac.uk</url> in
directory <code fspath>systems/web2c</code>).  Download the library,
unpack it, and delete the web2c directory (which is the bulk of the
distribution).  Configure and build it as usual, ignoring the warnings
about the missing main <code/texmf/ tree.

<subsect id=sgml.maths.latex export>&latex; maths within HTML

<p>The <em/real/ issue here (for me at least) is rendering
equations within an HTML document.  There are several tools available
which can do that with different trade-offs. The most popular method
is to write the equations in a &latex; document, process it, and then howk
the equations out of the resulting DVI file somehow (typically using
<code/dvips/ and a postscript to gif converter), and display them
on the web as gifs.  The big disadvantage with this is that you get an
awful lot of gifs, and the conversion is rather inefficient.

<p>All this hassle <em/should/ become irrelevant once we get browsers
which can render MathML directly.

<p>There are reviews of the problems, and some of the tools, in articles
<webref url="http://forum.swarthmore.edu/typesetting/index.html"
	><cite>Maths Typesetting for the Internet</cite></webref>,

with remarkable success, and with good failure strategies.  It works
very sweetly, but (a) requires you to tweak your browser to have it
map the symbol font appropriately, and (b) the resulting HTML can't be
printed legibly.  From the same source is

<subsect id=sgml.maths.other export>Other approaches to maths

<p>A quite different approach is to use a different markup for maths,
possibly requiring specialised client software.  These other notations
typically use semantic markup -- expressing the structure of the maths.
At first sight, this seems preferable to &latex;'s presentational
markup, but its weaknesses for authoring are exposed (I feel) when you
realise that maths is not as closed and unambiguous a language as
computer scientists feel it ought to be.  Semantic markup's strength
is in interfaces with computer algebra systems, and databases --
Abramowitz and Stegun would be ideal in this form!  The major
dislocation between the two approaches is what makes conversion from
presentational to semantic markup so easy.  In passing, I'll note that
MathML has both a presentational and a semantic variant.

<p><webref url="http://www.lfw.org/math/top.html"
	>MINSE</webref>
uses a server to render maths into gifs on the fly.  It seems to work
rather nicely, but works with its own semantic maths notation.

<p>There is (was?) a project called
<webref url='http://www.dcs.fmph.uniba.sk/~emt/'
	>Euromath</webref>, which includes a structured SGML editor.  This
project included a converter which could transform 
<webref url="http://www.dcs.fmph.uniba.sk/~emt/EmSystem.html#editor"
	>&latex; to Euromath SGML</webref>.

<p><webref url='http://www.nag.co.uk/projects/OpenMath/'
	>OpenMath</webref> might be a successor to Euromath.  It's an
EC Esprit project which `proposes to develop standards for the
semantically-rich representation of mathematics'.

<p><webref url='http://www.albany.edu/~hammond/gellmu/'
	>GELLMU</webref>
is a &latex;-like markup language, intended to be easy to convert to
SGML.  Specifically, it is intended to support maths (and hence
conversion to MathML) well.

	>EzMath</webref> is a Dave Raggett proposal for producing maths on

<sect id=tex.dimensions export>&tex; dimensions

<p>When producing this program, I became terribly confused about the
variety of dimensions which appear in DVI and PK files.  <ref id=tsizes>
is a summary of the sizes which appear, for the benefit of anyone else
attempting a project like this.  The reference [Dn] refers to
section~`<m/n/' of the webbed DVItype document and [Pn] to section~`<m/n/' of
the PktoPX document (see <ref id=refs>).

<p>If you feel I have misunderstood something here, or got one of the
conversion factors wrong (I hate these!), please correct me.

<li><code/s/ scales the design size, so that a font is actually used at

size.

<li><code/hppp/ and <code/vppp/ aren't used as sizes, but can be used
to check you have the right fonts by comparing resolution, etc..

<li><code/tfmwidth/ is the `physical' size of a character, and is the
only size that &tex; uses in its calculations, and which the DVI
reader uses when working out how far to move the reference point when
it sets a character.  This is defined in [P9] to be in units of
<code/FIXes/, where one <code/FIX/ is <m/2^{-20}/ points.  [D37]
describes how to multiply these widths by scaling factors without
overflowing.

<li>The difference between the pixel escapements and <code/tfmwidth/
is that the latter is a resolution-independent shift of the DVI
reference point, and the former is the PK file's recommendation of the
number of pixels the DVI processor should actually move.  The DVI
processor keeps track of the two reference points, and readjusts the
pixel-based one when rounding errors move it too far from the
resolution-independent one.  See [D89] and [D91]; also [D40].

</ol>

<p>A few useful conversions are:
<ul>
<li>The design size of a font is a physical length, of
<m>\mbox{ds}/2^{20}</m> points. [P12]

<li>A <code/FIX/ is a physical size, of length
<m>(\mbox{designsize})/2^{20}</m>

<li>A TFM width is a physical size.  The <code/tfmwidth/ parameter is
in units of <code/FIXes/, so that the TFM width is a length of
<code/tfmwidth/ fixes, which is equal to <m>\mbox{tfmwidth}/2^{20}
\times \mbox{ds}/2^{20}</m> points.
