  <p>There are no significant functionality changes from 0.12-2.
    However the build system
    changed significantly when the repository was relocated to sourceforge, and
    this warrants a new minor version, since the required changes,
    though they should be leaving the functionality unchanged, are
    more than just bugfixes.</p>

    <title>Release 0.12-2</title>
  </subhead>

  <p>Bugfix release.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The mmap configure code was wrong in that, while it wouldn't
          attempt to call mmap() on systems without a working mmap
          (`working' according to the AC_FUNC_MMAP test), it would try
          to compile it, which is incorrect.</p></li>

      <li><p>The problem was reported by a user who was building it under
          cygwin.  The <code>./configure</code> output which he
          forwarded suggested that the system did have
          <code>mman.h</code>, but didn't have a `working' 
          mmap -- so <em>it</em> thinks it's got mmap, but autoconf
          disagrees (I've no idea what autoconf takes as `working').
          The actual report was an `invalid cast' error which I've
          fixed.</p></li>

      <li><p>Add configure code to cope with systems which declare mmap but
          fail to declare <code>MAP_FAILED</code> (required by Single Unix and

  <p>New and changed functionality:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Add `unit' special, and fix bugs in the `mark' and `strut'
          specials.  This causes a few single-pixel changes in the
          reported locations of marks and the bounding-boxes coerced
          by struts.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Conversions between units (`pt', `cm', and so on) are
          generalised, and extra library functionality means you'll
          get this right more often.</p></li>

      <li>
        <p>Refactoring of internal logic handling magnification and
          unit conversions.  This is tremendously error-prone, and
          difficult to write a regression test for, but it produces
          apparently correct results as far as I've been able to test
          it.  Be on the lookout for subtle errors.</p></li>

<subsect id="rn-0.12b1" export="export">
  <subhead>
    <title>Release 0.12b1</title>
  </subhead>

  <p>New and changed functionality:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Input files are now mapped (using mmap(2)) if that functionality
          is available, and if they're determined to be seekable (ie, not a
          pipe).  This should increase the speed of access to large DVI files
          (but this probably wasn't a huge bottleneck before).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Modified DviFile::currH and currV so that they now report
          positions in multiple more useful units.  Enhanced library
          documentation.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Added dvireport.cc program to report the contents of DVI files
          (in a different way from the dv2dt suite), which also acts as an
          example of the use of the library.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Modify <code>--output</code> so that if there is no `%'
          character in the `pattern', <code>dvi2bitmap</code> takes this to be
          the name of the one output file; omitting the `%' was previously an
          error.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Added `mark' special; the format of the
          <code>--query=bitmaps</code> output has been consequently slightly
          enhanced.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Modified interface to <code>DviFile::getEvent</code> so that
          the returned event should be released by a method call, rather than
          <code>delete</code>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fixed bug which meant DviFile could search for PK files in
          demented sizes (non-initialised variable...)</p>

</subsect>

<subsect id="rn-0.11" export="export">

  <p>Bugfixes: correct semantics of DviFile::getEndOfPage, so that

    creating multiple bitmaps now works again.</p>

  <p>Major developments:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The program is a wrapper for libdvi2bitmap, a library which
          abstracts DVI and PK files, Bitmaps, and various other
          objects supporting these.  This is built as both a static
          and a shareable library.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Can read DVI files from a non-seekable stream such as a
          pipe.</p></li>
      
      <li>
        <p>Internal bitmaps are now expandable (no more guessing the output
          bitmap size)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Build system redone using automake and libtool</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Released under the GPL.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>A few minor option changes (hopefully the last ones) since the
          previous version</p>

  <p>Notes:
    <ul>
      <li><p>1: this is now more flexible.  Old <code>-fp mypath</code> is
          now <code>--font-search=path=mypath</code></p></li>

      <li><p>2: <code>-n</code> is (conventional) shorthand for
          <code>--process=preamble-only</code></p></li>

      <li><p>3: page-selection syntax has changed.</p></li>

      <li><p>4: extra syntax added.</p></li>

      <li><p>5: For consistency, <em>none</em> of the query options
          <code>--query</code> now automatially exit.</p></li>

    </ul></p>

  <p>Font searching can now be done by a script specified either at
    compile time, or as the argument to the
    <code>--font-search=command=...</code> option.  This frees you from
    dependence on the <code>kpathsea</code> library, without being
    therefore obliged to specify an explicit font path.
  </p>

  <p>Changes in the configure script:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Configure option <code>--enable-png</code> has turned into
          <code>--with-png</code> for consistency with
          <code>--with-kpathsea</code>, since part of this option's purpose
          is to indicate the possibly non-standard location of the
          <code>libpng</code> library.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Addition of <code>--with-fontfinder</code> option.</p>

  <p>Jeff Holt (<code>jeff.holt@hotsos.com</code>) noted build
    problems.  Either the RedHat includes or gcc have recently become
    fussier, which exposed a clash of prototypes within the kpathsea
    code.  Extra configuration code added to resolve this.</p>

  <p>Yamabe Kazuharu (<code>tako_da@qc4.so-net.ne.jp</code>) supplied
    a writer for XPM bitmaps.  This is built-in, not using the XPM

  </subhead>

  <p>Fixed a character-handling bug.  Oleg Bartunov
    (<code>oleg@sai.msu.su</code>) identified an error in the handling
    of some of the opcodes in the DVI file, which meant that only
    7-bit fonts were being set correctly (how parochial of me!).  He
    also sent me the fix -- many thanks to him.
  </p>

  <p>Also made a change to the options of the configuration script,
    turning <code>--enable-kpathsea</code> back to
    <code>--with-kpathsea</code>, which is more sensible, in
    retrospect (I think the processing of this was rather garbled in
    the previous version).
  </p>
</subsect>

<subsect id="rn-0.9-5" export="export">
  <subhead>
    <title>Release 0.9-5</title>
  </subhead>

  <p>Added some functionality, but more importantly corrected two nasty
font bugs.
    <ul>
      <li><p>Added options <code>-bp</code>, to set initial bitmap
          size based on paper sizes and <code>-Qp</code> to list the
          sizes available.  Added option <code>-PC</code> to turn off
          cropping, which is useful if you want output of a certain
          size.  </p></li>

      <li>
        <p>Fixed a bug which caused fonts loaded at magnified sizes to be
          requested at the wrong size, even though, when they were found to be
          missing, the correct font-generation command was being issued.
        </p></li>

      <li>
        <p>Fixed the longish-standing bug to do with spacing at smaller font
          sizes: cmr7 and cmr12 now look as their maker intended.
        </p></li>

      <li>
        <p>Corrected a bug which caused page-selection to be done
          subtly wrongly (font selections were being ignored, and byte
          values of 140 in DVI data would have caused merry hell).
          </p></li>

      <li>
        <p>configure script: The configuration for PNG now doesn't
          rely on a libpng version better than 0.96.  Font-generation
          is now enabled by default, despite the potential for
          confusion, which should be covered in the documentation.
          </p></li>

      <li>
        <p>Added better diagnostics to InputByteStream.cc, so that if it goes
          wrong, you're given at least a clue why.

      <li><p>Now option <code>-q</code> turns off warnings, but not

    something, which stopped it crashing for me (Mmmm...).

  </subhead>

  <p>No big changes, but a sufficiently significant change in the
    functionality to require a new minor version, rather than just a new
    release number.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The <code>-Q</code> options (see <ref
            id="usage.options.q"/>) now write their output lines (to
            stdout) prefixed by the option letters, so that the output
            of <code>-Qf</code> now consists of lines starting
            `<code>Qf </code>'.  This makes it easier to disentangle
            the output if several of these options are present -- it
            was added when option <code>-Qb</code> was added -- but
            means that any scripts parsing the previous version's
            output would break.  </p></li><li><p>Options
            <code>-Rf</code> and <code>-Rb</code> added (see <ref
            id="usage.options.r"/>), to set the foreground and
            background colours on the command line, rather than just
            using the <ref id="usage.special.fg">foreground
            special</ref>.  This is still a bit rudimentary, as it can
            be done only once, for the whole document.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>Some improvements to the PNG output, so that when
          transparent PNGs are viewed against their `natural'
          background, they look the same as the same image without
          transparency (ie, I fixed the relationship of the output
          palette and the alpha channel in this case).</p></li>

    <title>Release 0.8</title>
  </subhead>

  <p>Added support for palettised PNG output.  This was intended to
    allow me to support full transparency on PNGs, but the particular case
    which is appropriate for this seems to be very poorly supported in PNG
    viewers, so, although I believe the output to be correct, you can't
    see the benefit in most cases.
  </p>

  <p>That made it easy to support changing the foreground and background
    colours for output text, so I did that as an encore.
  </p>

  <p>Added the `strut' special.</p>

<subsect id="rn-0.7" export="export">
  <subhead>
    <title>Release 0.7</title>
  </subhead>

  <p>Version number fiddling: this is still beta software, and as such
    shouldn't be sent out with a major version number of 1.  Also, I'd
    been updating the `release number' (after the hyphen) with new
    releases -- this is incorrect, as this should indicate only
    bug-fixing or documentation changes, rather than changes in
    functionality.  I've therefore rationalised the version numbering,
    and changed history to the extent of modifying the notes in this
    ReleaseNotes section.  This shouldn't cause significant confusion,
    as this package has up to now only been circulated internally.</p>

  <p>Added support for PNG graphics, using the libpng library, if it's
    installed.</p>

  <p>The Metafont mode used for building fonts is now configurable at
    runtime; the default is configurable at configuration time; and
    default default (!) mode and resolution now properly match, so
    that you no longer have to give the <code>-r</code> option every
    single time.</p>

  <p>The manpage source was brought up to date.</p>

  <p>The <code>-f</code> option was split into the <code>-fp</code>,
    <code>-fm</code>, <code>-fg</code> and <code>-fG</code>
    options.</p>

  <p>The <code>--enable-fontgen</code> flag was added to the
    configuration script.</p>

  <p>Various clarifications to the documentation.</p>

  <p>Assorted tidy-ups to get it to satisfy <code>-Wall</code> on a wider
    range of platforms.</p>

<subsect id="rn-0.6" export="export">
  <subhead>
    <title>Release 0.6</title>
  </subhead>
  
  <p>Added support to allow the program to lie about its name.  For a
    discussion of the need for this, see <ref
    id="usage.fonts.finding"/>.</p>

</subsect>

<subsect id="rn-0.5" export="export">
  <subhead>
    <title>Release 0.5</title>
  </subhead>

  <p>Missing fonts are now generated by the program, and the
    <code>TEXMFCNF</code> variable is now set automatically (unless that
    behaviour is suppressed at configuration time).
  </p>

  <p>Support for more sophisticated cropping.</p>
</subsect>

<subsect id="rn-0.4" export="export">
  <subhead>
    <title>Release 0.4</title>
  </subhead>

  <p>The <code>DVI2BITMAP_PK_PATH</code> environment variable now accepts a
    colon-separated list of directories to search.  The font searching
    algorithm which uses that variable now does the font-size rounding
    calculation properly, and will additionally search for fonts within
    0.2% of the target size, as required by the DVI Driver
    Standard.</p>

  <p>The kpathsea font searching mechanism is still the preferred way of
    finding fonts, but since many folk don't have, or don't want to
    obtain, access to the library, I've made the simple
    font-searching algorithm marginally more sophisticated, as described
    above.</p>
</subsect>

<subsect id="rn-0.3" export="export">
  <subhead>
    <title>Release 0.3</title>
  </subhead>

  <p>No significant changes to functionality, but a couple of
    documentation and packaging improvements.</p>
