<subsect id=rn-0.7 export>Release 0.7

<p>A few small changes, including changes to the option list.
<ul>
<li>The Metafont mode used for building fonts is now configurable at
runtime; the default is configurable at configuration time; and
default default (!) mode and resolution now properly match, so that
you no longer have to give the <code/-r/ option every single time.

<li>The manpage source was brought up to date.

<li>The <code/-f/ option was split into the <code/-fp/, <code/-fm/,
<code/-fg/ and <code/-fG/ options.

<li>The <code/&ddash;enable-fontgen/ flag was added to the
configuration script.

<li>Various clarifications to the documentation.

<li>Assorted tidy-ups to get it to compile cleanly.

<li>Version number fiddling: this is still beta software, and as such
shouldn't be sent out with a major version number of&nbsp;1.  Also,
I'd been updating the `release number' (after the hyphen) with new
releases -- this is incorrect, as this should indicate only bug-fixing
or documentation changes, rather than changes in functionality.  I've
therefore rationalised the version numbering, and changed history to
the extent of modifying the notes in this ReleaseNotes section.  This
shouldn't cause significant confusion, as this package has up to now only
been circulated internally.

</ul>

<subsect id=rn-0.6 export>Release 0.6

<p>Added support to allow the program to lie about its name.  For a
discussion of the need for this, see <ref id=usage.fonts.finding>.

<subsect id=rn-0.5 export>Release 0.5

<p>Missing fonts are now generated by the program, and the
<code/TEXMFCNF/ variable is now set automatically (unless that
behaviour is suppressed at configuration time).

<p>Support for more sophisticated cropping.

<subsect id=rn-0.4 export>Release 0.4

<p>The <code/DVI2BITMAP_PK_PATH/ environment variable now accepts a
colon-separated list of directories to search.  The font searching
algorithm which uses that variable now does the font-size rounding
calculation properly, and will additionally search for fonts within
0.2&percent of the target size, as required by the DVI Driver
Standard.

<p>The kpathsea font searching mechanism is still the preferred way of
finding fonts, but since many folk don't have, or don't want to
obtain, access to the library, I've made the simple
font-searching algorithm marginally more sophisticated, as described
above.

<subsect id=rn-0.3 export>Release 0.3

<p>No significant changes to functionality, but a couple of
documentation and packaging improvements.
