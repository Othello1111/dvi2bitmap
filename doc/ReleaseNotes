<subsect id=rn-1.0-4 export>Release 1.0-4

<p>The <code/DVI2BITMAP_PK_PATH/ environment variable now accepts a
colon-separated list of directories to search.  The font searching
algorithm which uses that variable now does the font-size rounding
calculation properly, and will additionally search for fonts within
0.2&percent of the target size, as required by the DVI Driver
Standard.

<p>The kpathsea font searching mechanism is still the preferred way of
finding fonts, but since many folk don't have, or don't want to
obtain, access to the library, I've made the simple
font-searching algorithm marginally more sophisticated, as described
above.

<subsect id=rn-1.0-3 export>Release 1.0-3

<p>No significant changes to functionality, but a couple of
documentation and packaging improvements.
