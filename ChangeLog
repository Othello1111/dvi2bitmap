2003-09-30  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* Bitmap.cc, Bitmap.h : Added support for marks in bitmaps,
	settable by Bitmap::mark() and retrievable by getMark()

	* dvi2bitmap.cc: add `mark' special, to use new functionality in
	Bitmap.cc

	* DviFile.cc, DviFile.h, dvi2bitmap.cc, dvireport.cc: Added
	DviFileEvent::release method to release events, instead of using
	`delete'.  Documented that this is correct practice.

	* all: released version 0.12b1

2003-09-07  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* DviFile.cc, DviFile.h: added DviUnits enum,
	convertFromScaledpoints function, and expanded documentation

	* dvireport.cc, dvireport.1: added dvireport program, using above
	functionality, and acting as a simple example of the use of the
	library (used it to debug slight positioning problems with the
	textpos LaTeX package, so it's handy, too).

2003-09-01  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* dvi2bitmap.cc, dvi2bitmap.1: modify --output so that it sets the
	name of the output file, rather than a pattern, if there's no % char.

2003-08-22  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* InputByteStream.cc, InputByteStream.h, FileByteStream.cc:
	input files are now mapped with mmap, if that's available, and if
	they're determined to be seekable (ie, regular files).

2003-08-21  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* Bitmap.cc: Corrected scaleDown method: was working only for
	bpp=1.  That meant that the scaling stopped working, and you got
	heavily pixellated characters for all bitmaps after the first.

	* configure.ac: reorder check for getopt and co. -- should be
	after other library checks

	* all: Version 0.11 released

2003-08-12  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* DviFile.cc: getEndOfPage corrected; would have failed
	(never-ending loop, I think) if called after the last page.  eof()
	also corrected, so that it now returns true if the scanning of the
	DVI file has reached the postamble
	
2003-08-11  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* PipeStream.cc: Finally (?) debugged.
	* all: Substantial additions to documentation.  Version 0.11b1
	released

2003-08-03  Norman Gray  <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>

	* libdvi2bitmap Transformed into library.
	* all Reorganised using automake/autoconf/libtool.
