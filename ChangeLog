	* Bitmap.cc Corrected scaleDown method: was working only for
	bpp=1.  That meant that the scaling stopped working, and you got
	heavily pixellated characters for all bitmaps after the first.

	* DviFile.cc getEndOfPage corrected; would have failed
	(never-ending loop, I think) if called after the last page.  eof()
	also corrected, so that it now returns true if the scanning of the
	DVI file has reached the postamble
