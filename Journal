Sourceforge
-----------

Moved to sourceforge at the beginning of 2005, between 0.13b2 and
0.13b3.  See dvi2bitmap.sourceforge.net.  Released 0.13b3 from there.

Tagged dvi2bitmap-0-13 on 2005 August 19, and released it.

To make a release:

  * Update configure.ac, html/index.html.in, doc/ssn71.xml (in
    particular the <distribution> elements if this is a release of a
    new minor version, rather than a beta).

  * Tag the repository appropriately.

  * Build the release:

    % cvs -d :ext:normang@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dvi2bitmap \
        export -r dvi2bitmap-0-13 dvi2bitmap
    % cd dvi2bitmap
    % use config-tools doxygen
    # currently uses automake 1.9.6, autoconf 2.59, libtool 1.5.18
    % ./bootstrap
    % ./configure \
        --with-sgmldir=/Volumes/Boltzmann/Starlink/trunk/STAR/lib/sgmlkit \
        --with-png=/opt/local
    % make
    % make check
    % make dist
    % make webpage-tarball.tar.gz

Then:

  * Go to <https://sourceforge.net/projects/dvi2bitmap/>, and the
    project admin pages.
  * Upload the release tarball to ftp://upload.sourceforge.net/incoming .
  * Click on `File releases', then on `Add release' at the bottom.
  * Add a `New release name' like dvi2bitmap-0.13, and work through
    this form.
  * Upload the documentation (see below).
  * Mail dvi2bitmap-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
  * Potentially upload it to CTAN as well: www.tex.ac.uk/upload.html

See documentation at <https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6445&group_id=1#filereleasesteps>

To update the web pages:

    % make webpage-tarball.tar.gz
    % scp webpage-tarball.tar.gz normang@shell.sourceforge.net:.
    % ssh normang@shell.sourceforge.net
    sourceforge:normang> cd /home/groups/d/dv/dvi2bitmap/htdocs
    sourceforge:htdocs> rm -Rf *; tar xzf ~/webpage-tarball.tar.gz
    sourceforge:htdocs> rm ~/webpage-tarball.tar.gz
    sourceforge:htdocs> ^D

automake/autoconf
-----------------

From 0.11, uses autoconf/automake.  Needs autoconf better than 2.50
(I think -- the first one after this which I've used is 2.57)

Files to add:
    Notes (this file)
    configure.ac
    NEWS AUTHORS ChangeLog (to keep automake happy)
    ?files: install-sh mkinstalldirs missing config.guess config.sub
          COPYING INSTALL depcomp installed by automake
Files to delete:
    config/
    Makefile.in

To build:

    aclocal [? -I $D/tools/libtool-1.5/share/aclocal]
    automake --add-missing
    autoconf
    ./configure

I've disabled autoheader in configure.ac.  It's terribly clever, and
all that, but an extra step that can go wrong, and unnecessary, since
I have a perfectly good config.h.in.  Also, when I duly added that
documentation to each AC_DEFINE in configure.ac, the resulting file
isn't as nicely formatted, nor as rationally ordered, as the
config.h.in I started off with.  The magic that disables this is the
line `AUTOHEADER="echo autoheader ignored"' in configure.ac, following
<http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2003-01/msg00051.html>

OK, I've committed that in a form which builds dvi2bitmap, then
modified it to use libtool.  That involved adding AC_PROG_LIBTOOL to
configure.ac, but when I follow the instructions to run aclocal then
autoconf, it doesn't work, complaining that it can't find that
DEFINE.  So I installed libtool-1.5, then installed automake-1.7.5,
and now aclocal works if I add `-I
$D/tools/libtool-1.5/share/aclocal', but then automake fails because
it objects that it can't find ltmain.sh -- what's up?  I'll start
again from scratch (as far as all the ac... stuff goes) next time,
and see where that gets me.

Installed fresh copies of autoconf 2.57, libtool 1.5 and automake
1.7.5 in $D/tools/config-tools-20030608, and this now appears to work
if I bootstrap it with

    find . -type l -maxdepth 1 -exec rm {} ;
    rm -Rf Makefile Makefile.in configure aclocal.m4 config.status config.log autom4te.cache config.h
    aclocal
    libtoolize
    automake --add-missing
    autoconf

(I think automake is supposed to run libtoolize if ltmain.sh and
ltconfig aren't present -- according to the autobook documentation --
but it doesn't).  This set of commands is now in the script `bootstrap'.

With kpathsea in web2c-7.4.5, I can't build the dynamic library: I get
the "common symbols not allowed with MH_DYLIB output format" error.
This is due to an uninitialised global in tex-file.c.  I've submitted
a patch for this to the tex-k list.  Works when I configure with
--disable-shared, and works with a dynamic library when I apply my
patch to tex-file.c in the kpathsea distribution.

I've given up trying to use automake for the tests in tests/.  Instead
I'm just using Makefile.in.



Linking problems
----------------

I'm getting a variety of symbol-not-found errors on Solaris.  They
seem to be the same ones mentioned in
<http://www.tek-tips.com/gviewthread.cfm/lev2/4/lev3/29/pid/139/qid/90108>,
but the `solutions' presented there are extremely opaque, and seem to
refer to Sun's 5.0 C++ compiler, whereas the one on rlsul0 is 5.3
(however those notes are dated 2002 and the 5.3 compiler is 2001 --
what's happening?).  See also
<http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Programming_Languages/Cplusplus/Q_20313326.html>
for more opacity.  Hmm, there are also threads on Sun's forums' site
(searched for __deallocate_buffer on `Developers Site' and `Developers
Forums'.
See eg <http://forum.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=5&thread=6971>, which
refers to Bug ID 4632564

No, the problem seemed to be that I had a mismatched set of
autoconf/automake/libtool.  There's still something a bit wierd about
this, but as long as I do `make clean' now and again, it seems to
work on Solaris, though not on DUX.

So, as of 2003 August 11, it works on
